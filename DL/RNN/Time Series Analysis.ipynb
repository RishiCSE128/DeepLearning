    "Time series analysis is a statistical modelling techniques, Statistics can be classified into three types,\n",
    "1. __Descriptive__ - How the data looks like?, it's about  the data (e.g. Detabase models) \n",
    "2. __Predictive__  - Build a model of the data from its nature, answers some What-if type questions (e.g. predictive models, Regression model, classification model etc.). Typically its expressed as a function. A measure of goodness for predictive models is to validate the classification or regression error. \n",
    "3. __Prescriptive__ - What action to take to tune the model to steer the output to favourable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically regression models are used when the problem is descriptive (as it provides a function that tells the geometry of the dataset) but Neural-Networks is more used for predictive models. In a predictive models, the training set the validation set, they must be from identical polulations. In this context there are two major schools of thaughts, \n",

    "In prediction a function $y=f(X\\in \\mathbb{R}^n)$ is estimated that predicts an dependent variable $y$ based on a number of independet variables $x_1 ... x_n$. However, in time-series the dependent and independent variable are part of sequecnes and ordered by time $x_{t+1} = f(x_{t},x_{t-1},...,x_{t-k})$ or $x_{t}=f(x_{t-1},...,x_{t-k})$ train a NN with past data and predict the present, the same function $f$ is applicabe for predicting the future. Called __Auto-Regression__ (Regression on itself)\n",

    "A time series analysis problem is posed into two ways,\n",
    "1. Decomposition - decomposes the time series into a predictable part and a non-predictable (random) part. \n",
